# Halvorson.co.uk - React & WP-API

> Work in progress ðŸ’©

[Blog post on why/how/wtf](https://halvorson.co.uk/blog/rebuilding-halvorson-co-uk-using-react-the-wp-api/)

A single paged WordPress React site that uses the WP-API for all content. Currently just pulls in custom fields and blog posts to a homepage, about page and blog. The site will be expanded to showcase projects in the future.

This site is incredibly simple, as it stands it has the following pages:

- Home
- About
- Blog
	- Single Blog

The site uses React, WP-API, React Router, React Motion, React Body Class, Classnames and was bootstrapped with `create-react-app`.

##Plugins in use

- [ACF Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/)
- [Rest API Console](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api-console/)
