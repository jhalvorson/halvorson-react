# Halvorson.co.uk - React & WP-API

> Work in progress 💩

A single paged WordPress React site that uses the WP-API for all content. Currently just pulls in custom fields and blog posts to a homepage, about page and blog. The site will be expanded to showcase projects in the future.

This site is incredibly simple, as it stands it has the following pages:

- Home
- About
- Blog
	- Single Blog

The site uses React, WordPress Rest API OAuth 1, React Router, React Motion, React Body Class, Classnames and was bootstrapped with `create-react-app`.

##Plugins in use

- [ACF Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/)
- [Rest API Console](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api-console/)
- [ACF to Rest API](https://github.com/airesvsg/acf-to-rest-api)

##Plan 🚀

**The todo list:**

- [ ] React Router transitions
- [ ] Finish single post styles
- [ ] Add pagination to blog **Any pointers appreciated 👍🏻**
- [ ] Check proptypes
- [ ] Add footer
- [ ] Add tests

**Way in the future:**

- [ ] Add projects
- [ ] Add recent work
- [ ] Blog categories (WordPress, FabFit etc.)
- [ ] Add comments to blog posts



A full write up will be on the (new) blog once the project is live.
